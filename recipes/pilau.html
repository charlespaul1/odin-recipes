        <h4> <em>steps to making the pilau</em></h4>
        <ol>
            <li> Place the cumin, coriander, black peppers, cinnamon, cardamom and cloves in a dry pan.
                Roast over low heat until warmed through and fragrant and blend (I used a coffee grinder) until smooth.</li>
                <li>You need just 1 to 11/2 tablespoons for this recipe (depending on how fragrant you want the rice to be). Feel 
                    free to store the leftover spice powder in an airtight container for up to 3 months, or refrigerate for up to 6 months.</li>
                    <li>Heat a stockpot on medium-high heat. Add oil and heat until hot but not smoking.
                        Add the sliced onions and fry for 10-15 minutes or till the onions starts to turn golden brown (be careful not to burn it).</li>
                        <li>Add the garlic, ginger, serrano pepper, Cook for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant</li>
                        <li>Add the cubed beef, pilau masala, beef stock cubes, bay leaves, cilantro, and salt to taste. Cook until the meat browns and caramelizes stirring occasionally about 8 to 10 minutes</li>
                        <li>Add the diced tomatoes and cook for 4-5 minutes, until the tomatoes have released their liquid</li>
                        <li>Stir in the potatoes and the water. Bring to a boil and cook for 10 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Stir in the rice, and cover tightly with a foil paper (to keep the steam in) if necessary. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 20 minutes, until the rice is cooked and the liquid is absorbed</li>
                        <li>Once the rice is dry, remove the foil paper and fluff with a fork to ensure the seasonings are well distributed all around the rice</li>
                        <li>Serve hot with fresh Kachumbari </li>
        </ol>
